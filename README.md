# Product-Recommendation-using-NLP-and-CNN
This project recommends similar products, given a query product using two methods : NLP and CNN.
The data is gathered using Amazon's Product Advertising API.
Pickle files are used to store the state of data at every important stage.
NLP techniques used : Bag of Words and TF-IDF
A pretrained Convolutional Neural Network VGG-16 is used to extract feature vectors from all the product images in the dataset and stored in .npy files
